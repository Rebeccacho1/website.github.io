<div class="container container_background">
    Hello! You’ve found me, and I’m so glad you’re here; it’s meant to be!<br>
    <br>
    So I’m Rebecca Cho and welcome to my blog, Young Adventuress; a no-filter, vaguely chronological 
    space filled with stories and misadventures about my travels over the years with some
    musings about life thrown in for good measure. <br>
    <br>
    I’m that cliche “ordinary girl on an extraordinary journey” if one is allowed to say her
    own life is extraordinary at 20. Basically, I travel a lot. Usually alone too, that way 
    I don’t have to compromise. <br>
    <br>
    A friend once described me as cynical but kind in equal measure, a disturbingly 
    accurate bio. If you’re a fan of chaos, brutal honesty, sarcasm, and girls who think 
    they are wittier than they actually are, then you’ve come to the place. No, no don’t 
    run away just yet. <br>
    <br>
    If you find yourself in this part of the world, be sure to say hi! <br>
    <br>
    On my blog, you will find the most marvelous collection of stories of my travels, my 
    misadventures (of which there are many), and things I generally find interesting (also many). 
    Creating and experimenting are important to me. <br>
    <br>
    I am passionate about things like good coffee, reading, Antarctica, being outside and 
    conservation work (both here in New Zealand and overseas), and I believe that we are in
    the world to do good and to grow as much as we can. I like to inspire and make people 
    smile (and snort with laughter if I can manage it). I also ramble on a lot about birds. 
    Just roll with it. If you’re easily offended, you’ve come to the wrong place. <br>
    <br>
    I write like we are friends, you know, in a non-creepy way. Hi new friend! <br>
    <br>
    So pull up a chair, stay awhile.<br>
    <br>
    My blog is a collection of anecdotes and adventures that will hopefully entertain and make 
    you smile, and also not take life too seriously. But sometimes I also like to muse over the 
    bigger questions, like why abbreviation is such a long word and what can I do to be a better human.<br>
    <br>
    I’ve got a decade worth of stories on here, many of which I haven’t looked at since clicking publish, 
    so lord knows what kinds of goodies you might find on here if you start digging. No need to point 
    out all my typos, thankyouverymuch. <br>
    <br>
    In the meantime, if you want to catch up with me in real-time, follow me below and be sure to 
    subscribe to my emails!<br>
    <br>
    Nice to meet ya!<br>
    <br>
    Becs xx
